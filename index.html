                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                    language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as
                    Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements
                    such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core
                    JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by
                    supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Eum quam dolores, natus quo dolorem
                        possimus ut, nisi similique dignissimos odit corrupti facilis incidunt perspiciatis eligendi

                <p>This guide assumes you know the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on
                        the main page about JavaScript.

                    <h2>Javascript and Java</h2>
                </header>
                <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but
                    fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language
                    resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong
                    type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax,
                    naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was
                    the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
                <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                    declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a
                    small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and
                    string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model
                    instead of the more common class-based object model. The
                    prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is,
                    what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript
                    also supports functions without any special declarative
                    requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing
                    as loosely typed methods.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You
                    do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You
                    do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public,
                    private, or protected, and you do not have to implement
                    interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are
                    not explicitly typed.</p>
